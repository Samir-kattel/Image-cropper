# Some features
Can rotate the image left and right, flip horizontal and vertical. As above picture padding is added around the image to make it fit to the aspect ratio and we can also contain picture within aspect ratio. In defualt aspect ratio is set as 4/3 but we can change it to 16/5 also. We can zoom in and out, move left, right, up and down. We can also enable image panning and lastly we can hide the image. Above mentioned features can be enabled and disabled by clicking where we should.
